<h1 align="center">🎓 Student Academic Performance Dashboard</h1>
<p align="center"><i>A data-driven Streamlit application that explores how study habits, social media usage, and personal challenges shape university student CGPA outcomes.</i></p>

---

## 🌟 Overview

**Student Academic Performance Dashboard** is an interactive, analytics-driven web application built for university students, educators, and researchers. It visualises survey data collected from **88 real student respondents**, delivering meaningful insights into the relationships between daily study hours, social media consumption, coursework scores, and CGPA performance.

The dashboard goes beyond static charts — it lets users **filter by demographics**, **compare their own habits against peers**, and **explore interactive 3D visualisations**, all wrapped in a clean, professional UI.

Built with:
- **Streamlit** — reactive, multi-page web application
- **Plotly** — interactive charts, scatter plots, 3D visualisations
- **Pandas & NumPy** — data engineering and statistical analysis
- **scikit-learn** — machine learning classification models
- **Custom CSS** — polished, modern design system

## 📊 Dataset

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Source | Original survey — Google Forms |
| Raw Responses | 100 |
| Cleaned Responses | 88 (12 removed) |
| Features | 36 columns after encoding |
| Target Variable | CGPA (Low / Mid / High) |
| Collection Method | University student self-report |

**Rows removed during cleaning:**
- 4 rows — Gender: "Prefer not to say" (binary encoding not applicable)
- 3 rows — Study Method: "Others" (cannot be one-hot encoded)
- 5 rows — Study Challenge: blank, `-`, or `……` (no usable data)

## 🧪 Machine Learning (Notebooks)

The `notebooks/` folder contains a full ML pipeline separate from the Streamlit app:

1. **`Code_for_Model_Training.ipynb`** — loads RAW CSV, drops 12 invalid rows, maps free-text responses to categories, one-hot encodes all categorical features, and exports the Cleaned CSV
2. **`EDA_StudyHours_AcademicPerformance.ipynb`** — 5 interactive Plotly visualisations exploring CGPA, study hours, social media, and study challenges
3. **`Model_Training.ipynb`** — trains and evaluates 9 classification models using `RandomOverSampler` to handle class imbalance, with 10-fold stratified cross-validation and feature importance analysis

**Models evaluated:**
Logistic Regression · Decision Tree · SVM · KNN · Gaussian Naive Bayes · Random Forest · Gradient Boosting · AdaBoost · Neural Network (MLP)

## 🔑 Key Findings

| Finding | Insight |
|---|---|
| 📚 Study & CGPA | High achievers study **3.5+ hrs/day** — nearly double Low-CGPA students |
| 📱 Social Media | Students spending **5+ hrs/day** on social media have the lowest average CGPA |
| 🎯 Top Challenge | **Social Media Distraction** (22 students) is the #1 reported barrier |
| 💡 Quick Win | Cutting screen time to **< 1 hr/day** correlates with noticeably higher CGPA |
